- üîí **Simple Setup**: No server required - just open the HTML file!

## How to Use

### Option 1: Use the included API key
1. **Open the file**: Double-click `My chat bot.html` to open it in your browser
2. **Start chatting**: The API key is already included in the code
3. **That's it!** No installation or setup required

### Option 2: Use your own API key
1. **Edit the file**: Open `My chat bot.html` in a text editor
2. **Find line ~650**: Look for `this.apiKey = 'sk-proj-...'`
3. **Replace with your key**: Put your OpenAI API key there
4. **Save and open**: Open the file in your browser

## Changing Your API Key

To change the API key:

1. **Open `My chat bot.html`** in any text editor
2. **Find this line** (around line 650):
   ```javascript
  
   ```
3. **Replace with your key**: Put your new API key between the quotes
4. **Save the file** and refresh your browser

## Deployment

### Upload to any web server:
- Upload `My chat bot.html` and `logo.png` to any web hosting service
- No special server setup required
- Works on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any basic web hosting

### Local use:
- Just double-click the HTML file to open in your browser
- No internet connection needed (except for API calls)

## Optional: Server DOCX Export (Pandoc)

To generate DOCX with native, editable Word equations (OMML), run the small Python service and click the "DOCX (server)" button on assistant messages. The client will send the original Markdown to the server, which runs Pandoc.

### Prereqs
- Python 3.9+
- Pandoc installed on your system (macOS: `brew install pandoc`, Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install pandoc`, Windows: install from pandoc.org)
- Optional: LaTeX distribution if you later want PDF via Pandoc+LaTeX

### Install & Run
```bash
cd "My 1st project"
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

The API will listen on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. In the UI, press "DOCX (server)" on a message to download a DOCX with equations as OMML.

### Troubleshooting
- If you see "pandoc not found", ensure Pandoc is installed and on your PATH.
- On first run, macOS may block; allow Python in Security & Privacy if prompted.
